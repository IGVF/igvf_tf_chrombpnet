# 01.0.preprocess_nonpeaks.sh
# Purpose: GC-matched background regions, one set per fold, via
#          `chrombpnet prep nonpeaks`.
#
# This one step deliberately runs ChromBPNet's own code rather than a port.
# The negatives ARE training data: they are half of what every model in 03 and
# 04 sees. A reimplementation that differed -- by a rounding step, or by the
# order it consumes its RNG -- would silently change every model trained
# afterwards, and the difference would surface as unexplained metric drift
# months later. The bigwig conversion in 00.0 is a different case: its output
# is verifiable byte-for-byte against ChromBPNet's, so a faster path there is
# free. Here it is not worth the risk.
#
# What ChromBPNet does, per fold (all inside ${out_prefix}_auxiliary/):
#   1. bin the genome into `inputlen` windows every `stride` bp and score GC
#   2. slop peaks and blacklist by inputlen/2, sort, merge -> exclude.bed
#   3. bedtools intersect -v -> candidates.bed
#   4. sample, for each peak, unused candidates from the same fold pool whose
#      GC matches, walking +/-0.01 until a bucket has one free
#
# Step 1 is a Python loop over ~3M windows and dominates the runtime, and it is
# redone for every fold because the auxiliary directory is per-prefix. That is
# the cost of using their code unchanged; it is CPU-only and runs once per
# dataset, so it is paid here rather than on a GPU node.
#
# Seeded: `-s 1234` by default, recorded in the metadata. Same inputs and same
# seed give the same negatives.
#
# Output (per fold, under ${data_path}/${dataset}/):
#   output_${peak_type}_fold_${fold}_negatives.bed   10-col, summit at col 10
#   output_${peak_type}_fold_${fold}_auxiliary/      intermediates, kept
#
# Usage:
#   export DATASET=<name>
#   cd workflows/SLURM && sbatch 01.0.preprocess_nonpeaks.sh
#
# Prerequisites: 00.1.preprocess_peaks.sh, and references installed
#   (`cli.py download-references`) for the genome, chrom.sizes and blacklist.

# --- bootstrap: locate the repo root (identical block in every workflow step) --
# sbatch copies the submitted script to a node-local spool dir, so BASH_SOURCE
# does not point into the repo; SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR (the cwd at submit time) does.
# Walk up from whichever is usable until lib/bash/common.sh turns up. Override
# with REPO_ROOT if you submit from outside the checkout.
# An inherited REPO_ROOT is only trusted if it really is this repo -- the name
# is generic enough that another project may have exported it.
