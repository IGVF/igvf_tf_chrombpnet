# 02.0.qc_signal_peaks.sh
# Purpose: QC the signal, peaks and background BEFORE committing GPU time.
#
# Runs on the three artifacts training will actually use -- the prepared bigwig
# from 00.0, the filtered narrowPeak from 00.1 and the GC-matched negatives
# from 01.0 -- so the numbers describe what ChromBPNet will see, after every
# filter. Two halves:
#
# Individual, "is this good data?"
#   TSS enrichment          is this accessibility data at all?
#   profile at peak summits does the signal agree with the peaks?
#   peaks, widths, coverage how much is there
#   signal per peak         quantiles, and how many peaks have NO signal
#   fraction in peaks       signal-to-background for the model's regions
#   total insertions        against the depth ChromBPNet needs
#
# Comparative, "is there anything to learn?" -- peaks against their own
# GC-matched background, measured over one fixed window so the two sides get
# the same number of bases:
#   AUROC                   how well signal alone separates the two classes
#   enrichment              mean signal at peaks over mean at background
#   frac background >= peak median   background that looks as open as a peak
#   overlaid profile + distribution plots
#
# The comparative half is why this step runs AFTER 01 rather than before it.
# Separating peaks from GC-matched background is exactly the task ChromBPNet
# is being trained on, so measuring it first says whether the dataset is worth
# training on at all -- an AUROC near 0.5 means the peaks and the signal do not
# agree, and no amount of GPU time will fix that.
#
# Nothing here fails the pipeline: it is advisory, and the point is to read it
# before the GPU steps in 03 and 04.
#
# Usage:
#   export DATASET=<name>
#   cd workflows/SLURM && sbatch 02.0.qc_signal_peaks.sh
#
# Prerequisites: 00.0.prepare_signal.sh, 00.1.preprocess_peaks.sh and
#   01.0.preprocess_nonpeaks.sh.

# --- bootstrap: locate the repo root (identical block in every workflow step) --
# sbatch copies the submitted script to a node-local spool dir, so BASH_SOURCE
# does not point into the repo; SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR (the cwd at submit time) does.
# Walk up from whichever is usable until lib/bash/common.sh turns up. Override
# with REPO_ROOT if you submit from outside the checkout.
# An inherited REPO_ROOT is only trusted if it really is this repo -- the name
# is generic enough that another project may have exported it.
