# 06.0.average_contrib_scores.sh
# Purpose: Average DeepLIFT contribution scores across all 5 folds for
#          each dataset. One SLURM array job per dataset.
#
# Why: Each fold's model was trained on a different 80/20 data split, so
#      its contribution scores carry fold-specific noise. Averaging reduces
#      this noise and gives a more robust signal for motif discovery.
#      This follows the Greenleaf lab approach (their step 05-average_deepshaps).
#      05.0 also gives each fold its own DeepSHAP reference seed, so the
#      average smooths over reference noise too.
#
# score_types: both heads. 09.0 and 10.0 consume the counts average only;
#   profile feeds 07.0's profile bigwig and 08.0's profile TF-MoDISco. (Counts
#   used to be left out here because it had already been averaged in the 1.x
#   results tree; a chrombpnet 2.x results tree starts empty.)
#   average_contrib_scores.py skips a head whose output already exists, so a
#   rerun only fills in what is missing; delete an output to recompute it.
#   It averages whichever folds have scores and warns about the rest.
#
# Input:  ${full_model_dir}/{dataset}_{peak_type}_fold_{fold}/interpretation/
#             interpretation.{counts,profile}_scores.h5  (05.0), for each fold in ${folds[@]}
# Output: ${averaged_dir}/{dataset}/{dataset}_average_shaps.{counts,profile}.h5
#
# Usage:
#   export DATASET=<name>        # or DATASET_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yaml
#   sbatch 06.0.average_contrib_scores.sh              # dataset 0 (the default --array=0)
#   sbatch --array=1 06.0.average_contrib_scores.sh    # dataset 1 of ${datasets[@]}
#
# Prerequisites: 05.0.get_contrib_scores.sh must have completed for all folds.

# --- bootstrap: locate the repo root (identical block in every workflow step) --
# sbatch copies the submitted script to a node-local spool dir, so BASH_SOURCE
# does not point into the repo; SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR (the cwd at submit time) does.
# Walk up from whichever is usable until lib/bash/common.sh turns up. Override
# with REPO_ROOT if you submit from outside the checkout.
# An inherited REPO_ROOT is only trusted if it really is this repo -- the name
# is generic enough that another project may have exported it.
