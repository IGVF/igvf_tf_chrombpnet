"""Per-step run metadata, written as one JSON document per step invocation.

Every step emits a companion record describing what it read, what it wrote,
with which checksums, under which code and which tool versions. Many runs can
then be loaded and queried together::

    SELECT step, dataset, status, duration_s
    FROM read_json_auto('<root>/*/results/metadata/**/*.json', union_by_name=true)
    ORDER BY started_at DESC;

Schema notes, all of them chosen so that heterogeneous steps union cleanly in
DuckDB rather than producing a ragged table:

- Top level is flat scalars plus a few ``LIST<STRUCT>`` columns. Scalars stay
  queryable without unnesting.
- ``params`` is a list of ``{key, value}`` with ``value`` always a **string**.
  A plain object would give every step a different STRUCT and the union would
  be a mess. ``command`` keeps the full argv as ground truth; ``params`` is the
  curated subset worth querying.
- ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` share one shape, so they can be UNIONed into a
  single "files" view.
- Who ran it is recorded at two levels, both as flat scalars: ``user``/``uid``
  is the cluster account, ``git_user_name``/``git_user_email`` is the person
  from git config. They differ whenever a lab account is shared, and the git
  identity is the one that survives an opaque account name.

Checksums
---------
md5 is on by default and streamed in 8 MiB chunks. The expensive case is a
multi-GB fragments file, and that is precisely the step whose runtime already
dwarfs the hash. Set ``METADATA_CHECKSUMS=0`` to skip; the record then
carries ``md5: null`` with ``md5_skipped: "disabled"``, which is distinguishable
from a file that was simply absent.

Granularity
-----------
A numbered step name (``00.1.preprocess_peaks``) is one *sbatch job*, written by
the EXIT trap in lib/bash/common.sh. An unnumbered one (``preprocess_peaks``) is
one *tool invocation*, written by the Python script itself -- a job that loops
over datasets produces one job record and several tool records. The names are
kept distinct on purpose so the two granularities coexist in the same table
rather than double-counting; filter on ``step LIKE '__.%'`` for jobs only.

Failure
-------
Outputs are declared up front but hashed on exit, so a run that dies still
records what it *intended* to produce, with ``exists: false``. The record is
written for failed runs too (``status: "failed"`` plus ``error``). A step killed
with SIGKILL (SLURM OOM or hard preemption) cannot write anything -- the absence
of a record is itself the signal.
