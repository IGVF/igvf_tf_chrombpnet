# defaults below are the Engreitz-lab Sherlock install.

# ── Software environments ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every environment is a pixi environment, on the cluster and on molab alike,
# named as `pixi:<manifest>#<environment>` and entered by activate_env below.
#
#   chrombpnet 2.x (Keras 3 / JAX, CUDA from its own wheels) comes from a
#   separate chrombpnet checkout at a pinned commit, installed from ITS lock
#   file -- the one the port was validated against -- rather than re-solved
#   here. Its manifest is pyproject.toml; chrombpnet has no pixi.toml. Once:
#
#     git clone https://github.com/NNFC-GMD/chrombpnet "$CHROMBPNET_REPO"
#     (cd "$CHROMBPNET_REPO" && git checkout --detach "$CHROMBPNET_REV")
#     CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA=13.0 pixi install --locked \
#         --manifest-path "$CHROMBPNET_REPO/pyproject.toml" -e cuda13
#
#   (CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA lets a login node without a GPU install it; cuda13
#   needs NVIDIA driver >= 580 at run time, `cuda12` is the fallback.)
#
#   preprocess, finemo, finemo-cu126 and motif-compendium are this repo's own
#   pixi.toml environments: `pixi install -e <name>` from the checkout.
#
# Any of these can instead be a plain conda prefix, which activate_env enters
# with `conda activate` through CONDA_INIT.
